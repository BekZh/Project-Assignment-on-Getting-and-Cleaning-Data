 Feature Selection in the Original Dataset
=========================================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

Subjectid is an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. Its range is from 1 to 30.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, researchers 
captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have 
been video-recorded to label the data manually. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed 
by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth 
low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency 
components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was 
obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' in the original dataset
for more details. 


The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer is measured in standard gravity units 'g'.
The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
